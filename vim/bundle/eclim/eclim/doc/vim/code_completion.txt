Code Completion
***************

All the code completion functionality provided by eclim (ant, java,
etc) makes use of the new "User Defined Completion" added to Vim 7.
To initiate code completion enter insert mode and type Ctrl-X Ctrl-U.
By default Vim will open a popup if there is more than one completion.

*g:EclimCompletionMethod*

Note: If you would prefer to have eclim use vim's omni code
  completion instead, you can add the following to your vimrc:>

     let g:EclimCompletionMethod = 'omnifunc'

  <


  When using omnifunc you will use Ctrl-X Ctrl-O to start code
  completion.

Example with java completion

Once you have started the completion you can use Ctrl-N to proceed to
the next match and Ctrl-P to move to the previous match.

If you are like me and you find those key strokes a bit cumbersome,
then you might want to check out one of the following plugins which
can make completion usage less cumbersome:

- SuperTab (https://github.com/ervandew/supertab) This plugin's aim
  is to allow you to use <tab> for all your code completion needs.
- AutoComplPop (https://bitbucket.org/ns9tks/vim-autocomplpop) This
  plugin will automatically open the completion popup for you after
  you've typed a preconfigured number of characters. You can use
  AutoComplPop in lieu of, on in conjunction with SuperTab.
  AutoComplPop by default only supports triggering code completion for
  file types who have an omni completion that ships with vim, but you
  can configure it to support eclim code completion. Here is an
  example of some vim script you can add to your vimrc to enabled
  AutoComlPop for java file types (this example will trigger the
  completion popup when at least 3 characters have been typed after a
  dot, but you can tweak this to your tastes):

  >
     let g:acp_behaviorJavaEclimLength = 3
     function MeetsForJavaEclim(context)
       return g:acp_behaviorJavaEclimLength >= 0 &&
             \ a:context =~ '\k\.\k\{' . g:acp_behaviorJavaEclimLength . ',}$'
     endfunction
     let g:acp_behavior = {
         \ 'java': [{
           \ 'command': "\<c-x>\<c-u>",
           \ 'completefunc' : 'eclim#java#complete#CodeComplete',
           \ 'meets'        : 'MeetsForJavaEclim',
         \ }]
       \ }

- YouCompleteMe (https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe): Like
  AutoComplPop, YouCompleteMe will automatically open the completion
  popup for you and it also adds fuzzy matching of completion results.
  This plugin does have a compiled component to it so be sure to read
  their install docs thoroughly.
  Once installed, you'll need to add the following to your vimrc so
  that eclim and YouCompleteMe play nice together:

  >
     let g:EclimCompletionMethod = 'omnifunc'

  <
