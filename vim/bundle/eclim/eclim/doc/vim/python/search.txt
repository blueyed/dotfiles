Python Search

*:PythonSearch*


Element Search
==============

Element searching allows you to place the cursor over just about any
element in a source file (method call, class name, constant) and
perform a search for that element by issuing the command
:PythonSearch. By default this command will search for declarations,
but you can specify that you want to search for references using:

>

   :PythonSearch -x references

<


If only one result is found and that result is in the current source
file, the cursor will be moved to the element found. Otherwise, on
single result matches, the value of |g:EclimPythonSearchSingleResult|
will be consulted for the action to take. If there are multiple
results, the location list will be opened with the list of results.

Note: :PythonSearch does not currently support searching for
  patterns. Attempting to supply a pattern to search for will result
  in an error.

*:PythonSearchContext*

As a convenience eclim also provides the command :PythonSearchContext.
This command accepts no arguments and will perform the appropriate
search depending on the context of the element:

- If the cursor is on the declaration of a class, function, or
  method then it will search for all occurrences.
- Otherwise, it will search for the declaration of the element.

Configuration
=============

Vim Settings (|vim-settings|)

*g:EclimPythonSearchSingleResult*

- g:EclimPythonSearchSingleResult (Default: 'split') - Determines
  what action to take when a only a single result is found.
  Possible values include:

  - 'split' - open the result in a new window via "split".
  - 'edit' - open the result in the current window.
  - 'tabnew' - open the result in a new tab.
  - 'lopen' - open the location list to display the result.
  This setting overrides the global default for all supported language
  types which can be set using the g:EclimDefaultFileOpenAction
  setting which accepts the same possible values.

- g:EclimLocationListHeight (Default: 10) - Sets the height in lines
  of the location list window when eclim opens it to display search
  results.
