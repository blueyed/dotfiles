     default (see the Php Validation (|vim-php-validate|) doc for

*2.2.5* *1.7.13*


2.2.5 / 1.7.13 (Nov. 25, 2012)
==============================

Eclim:
   - 1.7.13 and above will now support Eclipse 3.8 as well as 3.7.

     project's links as well.

*2.2.4* *1.7.12*


2.2.4 / 1.7.12 (Nov. 18, 2012)
==============================

Eclim:
   - Updated |:ProjectTree| and |:ProjectTab| to support an arbitrary
     directory as an argument, allowing you to use the command for
     project's not managed by eclipse/eclim. :TreeTab has been removed
     since the update to :ProjectTab makes it redundant.

   - Creation of projects in nested directories in the eclipse
     workspace (vs at the root of the workspace) is now properly
     supported through eclim.

Android:
   - Updated for ADT 21.0.0.

C/C++:
   - Fix placement of some error markers.

Php:
   - Some indentation fixes.

*2.2.2* *1.7.10*


2.2.2 / 1.7.10 (Oct. 07, 2012)
==============================

Eclimd:
   - Updated eclimd script for Linux/OSX to supply reasonable defaults
     for heap and perm gen space if not already set by ~/.eclimrc.

C/C++:
   - Fixed C++ project creation to auto add the required C nature.

   - Fixed C/C++ issues introduced by the eclipse 4.2.1 release
     (project create/refresh and call hierarchy).

Java:
   - :JavaImportSort, :JavaImportClean, and :JavaImportMissing all
     removed in favor of a new command which performs the
     functionality of all three: |:JavaImportOrganize|

   - The vim option g:EclimJavaImportExclude has been replaced with
     the eclim setting org.eclim.java.import.exclude
     (|org-eclim-java-import-exclude|).

   - The vim option g:EclimJavaImportPackageSeparationLevel has been
     replaced with the eclim setting
     org.eclim.java.import.package_separation_level
     (|org-eclim-java-import-package-separation-level|).

   - g:EclimJavaBeanInsertIndexed vim variable removed in favor of
     suffixing :JavaGetSet methods with '!'.

   - :JavaCorrect, :JavaImpl, :JavaDelegate, :JavaConstructor, and
     :JUnitImpl all now perform their code manipulations using eclipse
     operations.

   - Initial support added for running :JavaSearch commands from
     source file results (library source files) not in a project.

   - g:EclimJavaCheckstyleOnSave replaced with the eclim setting
     org.eclim.java.checkstyle.onvalidate
     (|org-eclim-java-checkstyle-onvalidate|).

   - g:EclimJavaSrcValidate renamed to g:EclimJavaValidate.

   - :JUnitExecute replaced with a new and improved |:JUnit| command.

   - Added the command |:JUnitFindTest| to open the corresponding test
     for the current file.

   - Removed :Javac command since eclipse's continuous incremental
     builds typically make the :Javac call a no op, and in cases where
     you need to induce compilation, |:ProjectBuild| does so in a
     language agnostic way.

   - Added |:JavaMove| command to move a java source file from one
     package to another.

   - Added |:JavaDocPreview| to display the javadoc of the element
     under the cursor in vim's preview window.

=============================

Documentation:
   - Redesigned the eclim website using the sphinx bootstrap theme
     (https://github.com/ervandew/sphinx-bootstrap-theme).

     hopefully make them easier to find and make the docs less
     sprawling.

     (|gettingstarted-android|).

Java:

   - Fixed remaining tab vs spaces indenting related issues with code
     added via eclipse.

   - Fixed disabling of conflicting Eclipse keybindings on Juno while
     the embedded vim has focus (fixes usage of Ctrl+V for blockwise
     visual selections).

     (Juno, 4.2).

Eclimd:

C/C++:
   - Semantic errors are now included in the validation results.

   - Added folding support to C/C++ call hierarchy buffer.

   - |:ProjectRefresh| now waits on the C/C++ indexer to finish before
     returning focus to the user.

   - Fixed auto selecting of the tool chain when creating C/C++
     projects from eclim.

   - Fixed |:CCallHierarchy| from possibly using a cached version of
     the file resulting in incorrect or no results.

Java:
   - Fixed inserted code from |:JavaCorrect| when file format is
     'dos'.

   - Fixed off by one issue prevent several code correction
     suggestions from being suggested.

Ruby:
   - Fixed to prompt for the path to the ruby interpreter if necessary
     when importing a ruby project or adding the ruby nature to an
     existing project.

Vimplugin:
   - Fixed executing of some operations when vim is currently in
     insert mode (opening new file from eclipse in a new external vim
     tab, using "Save As" from eclipse, and jumping to a line number
     from the project tree etc.)
