Python Validation
*****************

When editing a python file eclim will default to validating the file
when it is written.  Any errors will be added to the current window's
location list (:help location-list) and their corresponding line
number noted via Vim's sign functionality.

Python validation currently uses both the python compiler to check for
syntax errors and pyflakes
(http://www.divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodPyflakes) to perform some
additional validation.  To make use of the pyflakes portion of the
validation you will first need to install pyflakes and make sure it is
in your path.

If you don't want python files validated when saving them, you can set
the g:EclimPythonValidate variable described in the configuration
section below.

*:Validate_python*

Regardless of whether you have validation enabled upon saving or not,
the command :Validate is available to manual validate the file.

*:PyLint*

:PyLint - Runs the pylint (http://www.logilab.org/857) tool on the
current file, populates the quickfix list with the results (:h
quickfix), and marks all the affected lines using vim's sign support.

Note: When running :PyLint, determining additional directories to be
  include on the path for pylint (http://www.logilab.org/857) is
  provided via eclim's integration with rope (|python-rope|).Please
  see the rope (|python-rope|) docs for more information.


Configuration

*g:EclimPythonValidate*

- g:EclimPythonValidate (Default 1) - If set to 0, disables python
